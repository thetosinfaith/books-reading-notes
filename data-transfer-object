### Data Transfer Object (DTO)

Source: [Martin Fowler - Data Transfer Object](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html)

This document summarizes my understanding of a Data Transfer Object (DTO) in programming.

A Data Transfer Object (DTO) is an object in programming specifically designed to carry data between different parts of a software application. In other words, it is just like a container or carrier that helps move information around efficiently and effectively.

Some key things to remember about DTOs:

- They only carry data, not logic or behavior.
- They are used to reduce the number of times data needs to be transferred.
- It improves performance and makes code cleaner.
- They deliver the data wherever it needs to go.
